In the raw files the top line records the date and time the experiment was opened,
and the bottom line records the date and time the experiment was closed.

NOTE: Some files also contain 'test' trials. These trials were from an initial version
of the memory test. This test was abandoned after research assistants reported that 
children did not understand the test. Data from this test were never analyzed. It was 
replaced by an alternative memory test with responses recorded on paper forms.
